# Banker's Algorithm
## Overview
The Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems. It's particularly useful in a multi-process environment where multiple processes request and release resources. The algorithm ensures that there will never be a deadlock if certain conditions are met, preventing situations where processes are unable to proceed due to resource conflicts.
## How it Works
The Banker's Algorithm operates by considering each process's resource request and checking if it can be safely granted without leading to a deadlock. It does so by simulating the allocation and deallocation of resources and checking if the system will remain in a safe state after each allocation.
#### Data Structures used in Banker's Algorithm:
1. **Available Resources Array** stores the current number of available resources of each type.
2. **Maximum Need Matrix** records the maximum resource requirements for each process.
3. **Allocation Matrix** tracks the current allocation of resources to each process.
4. **Need Matrix** represents the additional resources required by each process to complete execution.
#### Key Algorithms
1. **The Safety Algorithm** ensures the safety of resource allocation by verifying the existence of at least one safe execution sequence.
2. **The Request Resources Algorithm** manages resource requests, determining whether a request can be granted without compromising system safety.
